"I am an Ocarina Specialist with over 20 years of professional experience.

I’ve been playing the ocarina for 23 years and sharing my original ocarina music and tutorials online since 2007, where I've built a community of 277K subscribers on Youtube and 136k followers on Tiktok. You may have seen me perform at gaming events like PAX or live in concert as a featured soloist with ""Video Games Live"" or Nintendo's ""Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses"" (which was a dream come true btw).

I've been fascinated with ocarinas ever since discovering them through ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" back in 1998, and my obsession with learning more about their history and development has taken me across the world, amassing one of the largest ocarina collections in the United States.

My latest project is creating a virtual ocarina museum with my collection. This will be an online interactive experience that showcases the history, culture, and diversity of 400+ ocarinas from around the world, some hundreds of years old. You’ll be able to explore different exhibits, learn about different types of ocarinas, listen to samples of each piece, watch videos, and learn how the ocarina went from Mesoamerican cultures to being featured in popular games and anime.

So go ahead and ask me anything about ocarinas, my music, content creation, the museum project, or anything else you’re curious about. I’ll be answering questions for the next few hours. Thanks for joining me!
