Perhaps it was an accident involving a few rubber bands, a liquid lunch, and a particle accelerator. It doesn't really matter, it's done now. You now have to spend the rest of your life (*ha*) figuring out what to do with yourself.

At first you do all the dangerous stuff. Hang gliding, cave diving, crack cocaine, etc. You start stabbing yourself at the local bar as a trick to get free drinks. But you're running out of clean shirts that don't have knife holes in them.

You briefly dabble with thoughts of becoming a superhero, but crime never seems to just happen in front of you, and going out and looking for it is just so much work you guys!

You start investing for the long term. You're going to be around forever, what does 5% annual compound interest of $1 look like after 1000 years?

Oh god, you're going to live forever. What does that even mean?

You've got some time to kill, so start a hobby that'll take decades or centuries to finish. Then start a new one. Go to university to study physics and take a few hundred years to discover the quantum-gravitational theory, aka the Universal Theory of Everything. Then master every musical instrument and write a symphony, or 10. Then start doing crossword puzzles. You have time to do it all.

Don't develop close feelings for people. They'll all die, but you'll endure, and funerals are depressing (and for you, unnecessary).

You can have kids. Lots of kids. But you'll start losing track of them. They only really keep in touch for a few decades. And then they'll have kids and those kids will have kids and eventually you'll lose track of it all. Family doesn't have much meaning anymore once you have a billion or so family members but they all forgot that it was your birthday last Tuesday.

Realize that you'll outlive all of your enemies, you can afford to ignore them and just wait.  Why worry about anything, really. Climate change might make things uncomfortably hot, but you'll endure. The entire ",N/A,NONE,0,N/A,N/A

Having recently stumbled upon this subreddit (from r/StoriesAboutKevin, weirdly), I think this might belong?

Second semester of my freshman year, I was taking a music theory course. The professor was very serious about her job and this class was a bit of a weed-out class for students who wanted to pursue Music Education (I was taking it for fun). By the time the end of the semester rolled around, I got the feeling she didn't really like me much because I didn't pay attention in class but still got As on the homework/exams/playing tests (I'd played piano for a decade by this point), so she couldn't really punish me for anything since I wasn't disrupting the class, but was just a thorn in her side through lack of participation (thank god that wasn't part of our grade). Our final project was to find a poem we liked and craft a song using the poem as the lyrics. As she passes out the requirement sheet, she announced that she would be playing these for the class, so we need to put in effort so that we don't feel embarrassed by what she plays in front of everyone (about 30 people). She shoots a glance at me--the least involved student--as she says that, which I took as a challenge. I found a poem called [""A Minor Bird""](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-minor-bird/) and decided to craft my masterpiece in the key of E-flat minor. The reasoning: 6 of the 7 notes are lowered a half-step. So it's not a matter of thinking ""everything I see is lowered,"" it's ""everything but one note is lowered,"" which is fairly hard to keep track of while sight-reading something that utilizes both hands on the piano (we were to hand them in at the beginning of class and she would go through the stack and play them, without practicing first. It's a freshman-level class. How hard could it be?)

As a result, when our middle daughter and her cousin were born around the same time, my wife really expected them to also be best friends. With sixteen years of hindsight, I can say with certainty that the expectation was misplaced. 

Nothing happened in particular. My daughter just doesn't like her cousin. My wife keeps pushing the relationship. This includes making my daughter spend time with her cousin during family gatherings, inviting her cousin on trips, forcing my daughter to call her. 

We're pretty sure I'm the favorite parent (a fact that keeps my ego well-inflated), and, therefore, my apathy towards the situation is not well-received by my wife. From my perspective, this isn't important, and I do not possess the ability to make two teenagers become friends. I'm also pretty sure that trying to push this kind of knuckleheaded stuff makes kids not want to speak to you. 

This is where I'm probably an asshole. Yesterday, my wife forced my daughter to video call her cousin. My daughter rejected to request, and my wife told her: ""Unless you have a valid reason for disliking your cousin, you will do this because we're family"". The call occurred. This morning, we awoke to a PowerPoint presentation titled *Valid Reasons to Dislike \[Cousin\].* Using clips from the zoom call, segments included *Why is \[Cousin's\] Voice so Grating? A Music Theory Approach, A Case Study: Conversations That Provide No Value*, *Rethinking the Idea That There Are No Dumb Questions*, ect. With the benefit of a couple of hours of hindsight, it was a very cruel takedown of her cousin's entire personality. 

My wife was furious. My eldest daughter and I lost our shit laughing. My wife is demanding I support her in punishing my daughter for bullying her cousin. I have refused because I feel this is whole situation wouldn't have occurred if she didn't push the relationship, but I'm starting to have second thoughts because it was very mean.

I’m fine.

Bought bone conduction headphones two weeks ago to wear while running. They sit on your cheekbones and conduct vibration through your bones instead of through your eardrums to reach your cochlea. So you’re hearing music “inside” your head but can still hear all of the ambient sounds of cars, etc. 

Marketed as a safer solution for runners.

When I got them in the mail, I was surprised at how quiet my music was with these headphones. I had to turn them up almost ALL THE WAY to get even a half decent volume on my runs.

Turns out they were actually LOUD, I just couldn’t hear the music over the ambient sounds of the city. Today I tried plugging my ears and listening to them, and THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD inside my head. Unplug my ears and the perceived volume decreases.

So, the fuck up: I ran for an hour a day for two weeks with full volume music in my head. Without knowing.

A few days ago I started noticing sound sensitivity, headache, and ringing in my ears. Yesterday I went for another run with music, and developed a headache part way through. Today I woke up to a splitting headache and piercing high-pitched ringing. It’s lasted all day. 

That’s when I realized what must have happened. That’s when I tested my theory with earplugs and the headphones. 

I’ve had mild tinnitus for my entire life. I’m completely freaked that I may have permanently damaged my ears.



TLDR; accidentally listened to music at full volume for two weeks, possibly permanent consequences to my hearing

Don’t be like me, kids.

**MAIN PROBLEM**

Not enough people are making enough noise about net neutrality.

**WTF? WHY?**
 
People can't get motivated about net neutrality if they don't know what to do.

**MAIN PROBLEMS with NET NEUTRALITY**
* **Intro:** These are the problems that I have noticed with the net neutrality movement.
 
* **Disorganized**: There are several different voices shouting everywhere at once. People are confused on what to do.

* **Contradicting Messages**: There are contradicting messages about net neutrality. Believe or not, there are people who don't understand what net neutrality is **who are against it.** There's too much misinformation about this (*should be*) simple subject.

* **Confusion:** The contradicting messages about net neutrality have people confused. People don't want to feel confused.

* **Naivety/Blind Hope:** People don't want to feel hopeless about life. Net neutrality seems to be one of those subjects that seem way too complicated. They are trying to feel as happy as they can - if they know it's pointless because it's **an emotional defense mechanism.**


* **Circlejerking:** Most net neutrality supporters tend to spend most of their time where other net neutrality supporters are. They're not reaching out to people who desperately need to hear their message.


* **Low Morale:** Most net neutrality supporters (and the Internet citizenry as a whole) feel defeated. They don't know about Senators who support net neutrality or the those who have went from being neutral to being in support.


* **Perception:** The only people I have heard talking about net neutrality are Millennial kids. Older Americans (if they disliked Trump). Net neutrality is seen too much as a liberal thing, **and not a free speech** thing.
