The slop I have been eating every day for the last two years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyfoodporn/comments/1otncn2/the_slop_i_have_been_eating_every_day_for_the/,1otncn2,56360,5195,top,Past year,"Monday, November 10, 2025",08:28 PM UTC,NA,1964,"About 950 calories 
110 grams of protein 
35 grams of dietary fibre

Edit:
Since people are asking for the recipe:

Ingredients
2 Onions
650g lean beef mince 
1kg chicken breast
1kg mixed frozen vegetables
1kg black lentils 

1) Cook the lentils by simmering in beef stock for 15 minutes (I would advise washing them first but I don’t judge)

2) While that is going cut the chicken into bit size pieces. I butterfly the breast, cut length wise into strips, cut those strips into cubes.

3) Season the chicken

4) Dice the onion

5) Brown the onion to soft

6) Add the mince and season it

7) When mince is brown add the chicken

8) When chicken is cooked add the frozen veges with some water and close the lid

9) Once the veges are steamed and finished add the lentils.

10) Leave lid off until as much liquid has evaporated off.

Seasonings: salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, chilli flakes, garlic, ginger.

If you want to cut out unnecessary calories ditch the onions, I added them as a treat to myself :)

Edit 2: 
To answer some commonly asked questions

Do I enjoy it? Yes.

Am I autistic? Not to my knowledge.

Price? About R300/$17 for 7 meals.

Is this much protein bad for you? This thread has given me reason to do some research, but it seems like definitely yes.

Do you not get sick of this? No.

Are you jacked? Not yet.

Why? This is not just protein or nutrition maxing. I enjoy cooking (although I am still in a phase of improving), I just do not like cooking every day. I am not sick of this meal. Getting all of my health goals down in one meal allows me to splurge in other meals. I do enjoy eating, I am just wired in a way that I do not have to enjoy every single meal. 

Do I hate myself? No.

Am I a dog? Woof.

Why did you make it so dry? I did not know there where other options...

Why ziploc bags? Easy.

Edit 3:
Why are you eating out of a dog bowl? This is a cooking pot my grandmother gave me ):

Are you in jail? Not yet.

&gt;""Well, it's the Democrats' fault for not stopping him.""
&gt;&gt;With a better candidate they would have stopped him.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Because Dems need to be perfect and Republicans just need to exist.  You never see this in the reverse. GOP is politics on easy mode. They elected astronaut and WW2 veteran George Fucking Santos ffs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no way Trump should be president. So, who is to blame? Do you think Kamala Harris was the best candidate?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's like you didn't even read the comment you just replied to.  Kamala can both be a sub-optimal candidate and still have been light-years more qualified to be president than trump.  There is basically nothing Dems can do about the huge chunk of the country that either supports the right without question, or will vote for them because they buy everything the right says since they give simple answers to complex problems.  If the US wasn't filled with hateful morons, trump wouldn't have come close to winning.  But it is filled with hateful morons, so he won. Twice.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes I did.  Light years is a bit of a stretch.  Democrats can try to persuade voters with a relevant platform.  Saying the USA is filled with hateful morons doesn't help anyone.  Thanks for responding.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Democrats do run on a relevant platform, but they run on truth, or at least more truth than the Republicans do. Republicans run on easy soundbite lies, which cater to stupid people, while Democrats run on truths, sometimes inconvenient truths, and they don't make good soundbites that stupid people can understand.

Lost my baby girl of 8 years yesterday,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1iu4nj1/lost_my_baby_girl_of_8_years_yesterday/,1iu4nj1,35161,1415,top,Past year,"Thursday, February 20, 2025",06:54 PM UTC,NA,1999,"I’m sorry for the long post; a friend recommended writing my feelings out to help cope with what just happened. I typed everything out without proof reading and just let my thoughts flow through.

I lost my baby girl Ella after taking her to the vet last week for being lethargic. I knew something was wrong after noticing her quiet behavior for two days and got an appointment the same day. They said she was extremely lethargic, dehydrated, and after running blood work they said she was very anemic. They suggested we take her to the animal hospital over an hour away immediately for most likely a blood transfusion and testing they can’t offer locally. We rushed her there and got her the blood transfusion &amp; over the course of two days ran every suggested test they said would help find the reason for her anemia. All signs led to cancer of the blood marrow but was not definitive. They said we could do a flow cytometry which was to be sent to Colorado to further look into the blood cells and should tell us what was going on. I was able to take her home which I was so excited to start her on the prednisolone and antibiotic the doctor gave, hoping it would make her better. She was very tired but I could tell in better condition than before. I opted in for the liquid medication because I knew she was not going to let me put a pill in her mouth lol, she even fought me with the liquid meds. After about three days she wasn’t eating much again and barely drank any water. I spent every night with her these past few days, just petting her, telling her how much I love her, and that I could not have asked for a better kitty. Even though she was extremely weak she would get out of her little bed and position herself on my arm and fall asleep. Yesterday morning I realized she’s not having any good days and I didn’t want my baby to suffer anymore. I work from home and I brought all of my office things into her bedroom and I just worked on the floor right next to her while she slept.",https://i.redd.it/045jp5gj1cke1.jpg; https://i.redd.it/n8s2f6gj1cke1.jpg; https://i.redd.it/forl46gj1cke1.jpg; https://i.redd.it/9zokg6gj1cke1.jpg; https://i.redd.it/bb8666gj1cke1.jpg; https://i.redd.it/yfwah6gj1cke1.jpg,IMAGE,1,bestchairfordevelopers_top_pastyear_4_img.jpg; bestchairfordevelopers_top_pastyear_4_img.jpg; bestchairfordevelopers_top_pastyear_4_img.jpg; bestchairfordevelopers_top_pastyear_4_img.jpg; bestchairfordevelopers_top_pastyear_4_img.jpg; bestchairfordevelopers_top_pastyear_4_img.jpg,NA
