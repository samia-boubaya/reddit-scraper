""Accept the truth! Your kind has had their time! Robots are the next step in the chain of evolution!""*

An underrated, little known character from an underrated, little known show. Ondai is one of the galactic racing champions partaking in the Great Race of Oban for the so-called  ""Ultimate Prize"". He is an extraterrestrial robot with superhuman calculating abilities and a Sheldon Cooper-esque attitude. Secretly though, he hopes to experience feeling and touch, a sensation that forever eludes a machine. Ondai is designed for thinking, not fighting, but when he plugs into his Star racer, he becomes a powerful mechanized opponent.

We’ve made each trap destructible. Note: The animations are currently demonstrating and will be fixed in the game. My map artist Nameless is eager to share their progress. ❤️‍🔥

Map 2 Production Begins Today

Riza will be developing Map 2, as Alwas is very detailed and heavy in terms of tasks. Therefore, we’ve decided to divide the workload.

Programming Update

We’re testing Godot 2D and 3D mechanics this week! Our programmer was away but has returned and is now working again.

Happy 20th Anniversary to Oban! We’re working hard to reveal a grand in-game reveal soon!

We hope you enjoyed our behind-the-scenes look 👀
