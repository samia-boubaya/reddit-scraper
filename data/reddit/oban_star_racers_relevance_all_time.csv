Oban Star Racers Chance to Shine Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/obanstarracers/comments/1oiumb2/oban_star_racers_chance_to_shine_update/,1oiumb2,190,24,relevance,All time,"Wednesday, October 29, 2025",04:51:36 AM UTC,1 month 1 week 1 day ago,1994,"Mhahaha your Kitty has returned lol

-All ships finished ✅ 
-Map 1 Alwas is finished ✅
-Traps being animated and updated on Patreon before public release.
-Hand Drawn Racers are scheduled after FoA Dragon 🐉 my 3 Animators are making beautiful progress.
-We been playing around with engines Godot and Unity 3D. To test splines among other requirements for the mix 2D and 3D racing.

Yes I been continuing its development and haven’t given up. I got the Rights to develop Oban Games from Savin. Thanks to the softwares we can play the game on mobile, consoles and pc. For now Im purely focused on Gameplay and Visuals. As you can see we recovered the original Style for Oban. We even sent out a helpful detective Lock for hunting down all Media and Games recovering all of Obans Legacy. It’s been quite a journey figuring out gameplay smoothness and style. I invested my financials into this and hope it delivers on accuracy.

I paid professional Artists to paint every single piece and added Animations to everything. We restored the models for the Racers as well. My Programmer Lee is putting the Art in Godot for testing in November. I am keeping my team size as 3 devs for CTS. It’s been easier for me to manage and paying them when I have the money each month for their Commissions. Some great news as I have full control of the Oban Games I want todo what I love and share the progress with the community. So Play testing, Animations and Level Design will always be shared with the community on Patreon then shortly thereafter to Public.

I was going to Post 10 months ago on here but I was going through a lot of financial, health and living situations. I Post on BlueSky Social as primary but deleted Facebook, Instagram and Twitter due to AI stealing. Please don’t ask about release date or multiplayer or campaign. I really want to focus on Art and Gameplay while everyone in the community can enjoy and give feedback. I am not a wealthy kitty I could not afford to keep Sky Isle Studios and ","https://i.redd.it/gvmo4fsz3zxf1.gif

Map 2 Production Begins Today

Riza will be developing Map 2, as Alwas is very detailed and heavy in terms of tasks. Therefore, we’ve decided to divide the workload.

Programming Update

We’re testing Godot 2D and 3D mechanics this week! Our programmer was away but has returned and is now working again.

Happy 20th Anniversary to Oban! We’re working hard to reveal a grand in-game reveal soon!

We hope you enjoyed our behind-the-scenes look 👀
